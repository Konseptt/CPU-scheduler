# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulator

## Description
This project is an interactive web-based CPU scheduling algorithm simulator featuring multiple scheduling algorithms with visualization. It is created for educational purposes to help understand how different CPU scheduling algorithms work.

## Installation
To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Konseptt/CPU-scheduler.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CPU-scheduler
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the simulator.

## Usage
1. Select a CPU scheduling algorithm from the dropdown menu.
2. Enter the arrival times, burst times, and priority values (if applicable) for the processes.
3. Click the "Process Input" button to add the processes.
4. Click the "Calculate" button to visualize the scheduling algorithm and see the results.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or improvements, please create a pull request or open an issue on GitHub.

## Examples
Here are some examples of how to use the simulator:

### Example 1: First Come First Served (FCFS)
- Arrival Times: `0 1 2 3`
- Burst Times: `3 6 4 5`

### Example 2: Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Arrival Times: `0 1 2 3`
- Burst Times: `6 8 7 3`
